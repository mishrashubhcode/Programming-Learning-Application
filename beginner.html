  <h1>Basic Concepts of Python</h1>
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language that was first released in 1991. It is designed to be easy to read and write, and is known for its clear and concise syntax. Python is an object-oriented language, which means that it is built around the concept of objects, which can contain data and code.</p>

  <h2>Data Types</h2>
  <p>Python has several built-in data types, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Numbers (integers, floats, and complex numbers)</li>
    <li>Strings</li>
    <li>Lists</li>
    <li>Tuples</li>
    <li>Dictionaries</li>
    <li>Sets</li>
    <li>Booleans</li>
    <li>None</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Variables</h2>
  <p>In Python, a variable is a name that refers to a value. Variables are created when they are first assigned a value. Python uses dynamic typing, which means that a variable can refer to a value of any type. Variable names are case-sensitive.</p>

  <h2>Operators</h2>
  <p>Python has several types of operators, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, %, //, **)</li>
    <li>Comparison operators (==, !=, >, <, >=, <=)</li>
    <li>Assignment operators (=, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, //=, **=)</li>
    <li>Logical operators (and, or, not)</li>
    <li>Identity operators (is, is not)</li>
    <li>Membership operators (in, not in)</li>
    <li>Bitwise operators (&, |, ^, ~, <<, >>)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Control Flow</h2>
  <p>Python has several types of control flow statements, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>If statements</li>
    <li>For loops</li>
    <li>While loops</li>
    <li>Try/except statements</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Functions</h2>
  <p>A function is a block of code that performs a specific task. Functions can take parameters as input, and can return a value as output. In Python, functions are defined using the def keyword.</p>

  <h2>Modules</h2>
  <p>A module is a file that contains Python code. Modules can be imported into other Python code using the import statement. Python has a large standard library of modules that can be used for a variety of tasks.</p>
